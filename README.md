    User experience - Flash messages, form validation, and intuitive interactions

    Modern CSS - Gradient backgrounds, animations, and professional styling

DevOps & Deployment

    Environment management - Using .env files and production configurations

    Git workflow - Version control and collaborative development practices

    Cloud deployment - Understanding production vs development environments

Problem-Solving & Debugging

    Reading error messages - Learning to interpret Flask/Python errors

    Systematic debugging - Using print statements and logical thinking

    Research skills - Finding solutions and understanding documentation

Feel free to create an account and try out the functionality. Each user's notes are completely private and secure.

*Note: The app may take 30-60 seconds to wake up if it hasn't been accessed recently (this is normal for Render's free tier).*
