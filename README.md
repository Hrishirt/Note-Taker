## 🚀 Live Demo

**[✨ Try the app live here: https://note-taker-e3ie.onrender.com/](https://note-taker-e3ie.onrender.com/)**

Feel free to create an account and try out the functionality. Each user's notes are completely private and secure.

*Note: The app may take 30-60 seconds to wake up if it hasn't been accessed recently (this is normal for Render's free tier).*
